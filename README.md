## Background

This is a client library for looking up DIDs in either:

- an OIDF registry using the /fetch?sub= oidf endpoint to lookup the did, passing it as the value of the 'sub' paramter
- a static list of DIDs encoded in the format heretofore used by the DCC for it's member and community registries, and served publicly, like this one: https://github.com/digitalcredentials/dcc-community-registry/registry.json


## Security

Assumes the loaded registries are public, accessible via `https`.

Note that an individual DID can appear in multiple registries.
Because of that, the _order_ of registries loaded matters. For example, given
a registry list:

```js
const knownRegistries = [{
    "name": "DCC Pilot Registry",
    "url": "https://digitalcredentials.github.io/issuer-registry/registry.json"
  },
  {
    "name": "DCC Sandbox Registry",
    "url": "https://digitalcredentials.github.io/sandbox-registry/registry.json"
  }]
```

If an issuer DID is contained in both of those registries, the issuer entry
(that contains the issuer name and URL) will come from the _first_ registry,
"DCC Pilot Registry".

In other words, verifiers and other implementers must order the registries
_in order of most authoritative to least_.

## Install

- Node.js 18+ is recommended.

### NPM

To install via NPM:

```
npm install @digitalcredentials/issuer-registry-client
```

### Development

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalcredentials/issuer-registry-client.git
cd issuer-registry-client
npm install
```

## Usage

First, put together an array of known issuer and verifier registries you would
like to check against, like this publicly available copy of the DCC known registries:

https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-known-registries/known-did-registries.json

which as of apr 22 2025 looked like so (reproduced here for convenience):

```js
[
    {
        "type": "oidf",
        "fetchEndpoint": "https://registry.dcconsortium.org/fetch?sub=",
        "name": "DCC Member Registry"
    },
    {
        "type": "dcc-legacy",
        "name": "DCC Sandbox Registry",
        "url": "https://digitalcredentials.github.io/sandbox-registry/registry.json"
    },
    {
        "type": "dcc-legacy",
        "name": "DCC Community Registry",
        "url": "https://digitalcredentials.github.io/community-registry/registry.json"
    },
    {
        "type": "dcc-legacy",
        "name": "MSP Registry",
        "url": "https://sandbox-issuer.myskillspocket.com/registry.json"
    }
]
```

You can then use that list with this client:

```js
import { RegistryClient } from '@digitalcredentials/issuer-registry-client'

const registries = new RegistryClient()

const response = await fetch("https://digitalcredentials.github.io/dcc-known-registries/known-did-registries.json");
const knownRegistries = await response.json();
await registries.load({ config: knownRegistries })

// You can now query to see if a DID is known in any registry
console.log(registries.didEntry('did:key:z6MkpLDL3RoAoMRTwTgo3rs39ZwssfaPKtGdZw7AGRN7CK4W'))
/**
DidMapRegistryEntry {
  name: 'My University',
  url: 'https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu',
  location: 'Cambridge, MA, USA',
  inRegistries: Set(2) {
    {
      name: 'DCC Community Registry',
      url: 'https://digitalcredentials.github.io/community-registry/registry.json',
      rawContents: [Object]
    },
    {
      name: 'DCC Sandbox Registry',
      url: 'https://digitalcredentials.github.io/sandbox-registry/registry.json',
      rawContents: [Object]
    }
  }
}
 */

registries.didEntry('did:example:does-not-exist')
// undefined
```
